# ChIP-seq-Analysis-

This repository contains the complete workflow for ChIP-seq analysis of the SEP3 transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana using 2-day samples (rep1 & rep2) and their input control from the public dataset BioProject PRJNA203220
.

The aim of this project is to identify SEP3 binding sites, annotate genomic regions, and visualize peak enrichment patterns to understand transcriptional regulation during early flower development.
